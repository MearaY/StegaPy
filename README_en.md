**StegaPy** is a Python-based information hiding (steganography) tool inspired by [OpenStego](https://github.com/syvaidya/openstego). It is a powerful steganography tool for hiding data and embedding digital watermarks in image files.

## 📋 About

This project is a Python-based steganography tool inspired by the OpenStego project. It is developed in Python and implements core functionality while introducing some improvements and extensions. Please note that this is a work in progress and may have limitations or incomplete features. Ongoing maintenance and improvements are planned.

- 🔄 **Feature Implementation**: Major steganography and watermarking algorithms
- 🌐 **Modern Web Interface**: Interactive web application built with Streamlit for easier use
- 📝 **Code Quality**: PEP 8 compliant with type hints and documentation
- 🏗️ **Modular Design**: Plugin-based architecture for better maintainability
- 💻 **Cross-Platform Support**: Native Python cross-platform support for easier deployment
- 📦 **Python Ecosystem**: Utilizes libraries like NumPy and Pillow for enhanced performance

**Note**: This is an experimental project. Some features may not be fully implemented or tested. Feedback is welcome.


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Environment Setup

#### Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate StegaPy
```

#### Using pip

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package (development mode)
pip install -e .
```

### Web Interface

Start the Streamlit web application:

```bash
# Use default port (usually 8501)
streamlit run app.py

# Or specify a custom port (recommended to use an available port, e.g., 8501)
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
```

The web interface provides complete functionality, including:
- Data hiding (embed/extract)
- Digital watermarking (generate/embed/verify)
- Image difference visualization
- Real-time processing feedback
